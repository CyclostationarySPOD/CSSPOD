# Cyclostationary Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (CS-SPOD) in Matlab <a href="https://github.com/CyclostationarySPOD/CSSPOD/blob/main/LICENSE.md"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg" />


CSSPOD() is a Matlab implementation of the cyclostationary extension of spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (CS-SPOD) [1]. CS-SPOD is suitable for analyzing flows that exhibit periodic statistics. Examples of these cyclostationary flows include:		
	
  1. Flows with harmonic actuation (e.g. a periodically forced turbulent jet)	
  2. Turbines/rotors/VAWT/turbomachinery	
  3. Bluff body vortex shedding	
  4. Atmospheric (climate) data	
  5. Many others...
     
CS-SPOD determines the optimal decomposition of these cyclostationary flows in an analogous way that SPOD determines the optimal decomposition of statistically stationary flows. CS-SPOD becomes SPOD when analyzing statistically stationary flows. CS-SPOD is a multidimensional version of [3] using the method-of-snapshot technique for computational feasibility.

## Harmonically forced turbulent jet database
The large-eddy simulation data provided along with this example is a subset of the database of a harmonically forced (St_f=1.5) Mach 0.4 turbulent jet described in [2] and was calculated using the unstructured flow solver Charles developed at Cascade Technologies [4]. If you are using the database in your research or teaching, please include explicit mention of [2,4]. The test database consists of 25000 snapshots of the symmetric component (m=0) of a round turbulent jet.
